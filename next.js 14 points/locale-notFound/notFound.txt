app ---
       [locale]
               [...not_found] --> page.tsx
               global.css
               layout.tsx
               not-found.tsx
               page.tsx


So here we are : 
For adding a new custom 404 not found page to your nextjs 14 projects you need to do 2 things.
Crate a not-found.tsx component and put it in your root project under [locale] this will be your custom 404 not found page 
Crate a page called [...not_found] in the root project under [locale] and add notFound() from next/navigation to it.


in not_found.tsx add your custom 404 page

// not-found.tsx
export default function NotFound() {
  return <div>404 not found</div>;
} 

// app/[locale]/[...not_found]/page.tsx
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

export default function NotFoundCatchAll() {
  notFound();
}
